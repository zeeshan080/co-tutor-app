This Tutorial is based on the following video [How To Prompt ChatGPT The RIGHT WAY In 2025 (you're doing it wrong)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv_sAnH_P8Q)

Most people are using AI like ChatGPT entirely wrong. They ask broken questions in new chats without proper context, missing out on AI's true potential. This tutorial will teach you the complete prompting framework that can 10x your productivity and help you get professional-level results from any AI tool.

## Why Prompting Skills Matter

In the near future, professionals who master AI prompting will have a significant advantage. We're already seeing:
- Doctors using AI to help diagnose patients
- Engineers prompting AI to solve complex problems  
- Lawyers using AI to speed up research and catch missed details

Instead of waiting to be replaced by AI, learn to work with it effectively.

## The 6-Part Prompting Framework

This framework works across all major AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and is based on fundamental principles of how large language models operate.

### 1. Command: Start Strong, Not Soft

**The Problem:** Most people ask vague questions or make wishy-washy requests.

**The Solution:** Every great prompt starts with a clear, direct command using action verbs.

**Bad Example:**
```
Give me investing advice
```

**Good Example:**
```
Recommend a diversified investment strategy for a moderate risk investor saving for a home within 5 years
```

**Key Principles:**
- Use strong action verbs: analyze, create, design, recommend, generate, evaluate
- Avoid weak words like "give" or "help"
- Be specific about what you want
- Set a professional, focused tone

### 2. Context: More is Always Better

**The Rule:** AI can take your prompt in any direction if you let it. Your job is to narrow it down with the right background, constraints, and goals.

**Bad Example:**
```
Recommend a diversified investment strategy for me
```

**Good Example:**
```
Recommend an investment strategy for a 32-year-old with moderate risk tolerance, earning $90,000/year, saving to buy a home in 5 years
```

**The Rule of Three Framework:**
- **Who:** Age, profession, experience level, situation
- **What:** Specific goal, constraints, requirements
- **When:** Timeline, deadlines, urgency

**Context Scaling:**
- Simple requests (restaurant recommendation): Minimal context needed
- Complex projects (business plan): Extensive context required
- Life-changing decisions: Maximum context investment

### 3. Logic: Define the Output Structure

**The Problem:** Without guidance, AI will respond in whatever format it chooses, which might not be useful for your needs.

**The Solution:** Tell the AI exactly how to think and respond.

**Basic Example:**
```
List the asset categories, explain the percent allocation for each, and briefly justify the rationale behind each choice
```

**Advanced Formatting Options:**
- "Format this as a screenshotable Apple Notes format"
- "Give me a copy-and-pasteable asset I can send to my partner"
- "Respond in PDF format for saving and sharing"
- "Create this as a table with columns for..."
- "Structure this as an interactive checklist"

**Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- Do I want this in a table, graph, or list format?
- Will I need to share this with others?
- How will I use this information next?

### 4. Roleplay: Transform Generic into Expert-Level

**The Power:** The way you prompt doesn't just affect what AI says—it affects who it becomes.

**Basic Example:**
```
You are a certified financial advisor with 15 years of experience specializing in personal finance and mid-term investment planning
```

**Role Variations by Field:**
- **Finance:** "Certified financial advisor with 15 years experience in personal finance"
- **Marketing:** "Senior marketing strategist with expertise in digital campaigns"  
- **Technology:** "Senior software architect with 10 years in enterprise systems"
- **Legal:** "Corporate lawyer with 10 years experience in contract law"

**Style and Tone Modifiers:**
- "Be brutally honest and conservative in your advice"
- "Take a creative and innovative approach"
- "Provide practical, actionable recommendations"
- "Focus on data-driven insights"

### 5. Formatting: Structure for Success

**The Goal:** Organize information in a way that's immediately useful and actionable.

**Example Structure:**
```
Format the response as a clear list with bullet points under three sections:
1. Asset Allocation (with percentages)
2. Rationale for Each Category  
3. Risk Considerations
```

**Popular Formatting Options:**
- Numbered lists for sequential steps
- Bullet points for equal-weight items
- Tables for comparing options
- Sections with headers for complex topics
- Summary boxes for key takeaways

### 6. Questions: The Secret Sauce

**The Game-Changer:** After building your complete prompt (command + context + logic + roleplay + formatting), add this powerful ending:

```
Ask me 10 questions that will help you tailor this strategy even more
```

**Why This Works:**
- AI identifies gaps in your prompt that you missed
- Provides nuanced questions you hadn't considered
- Leads to dramatically better, more personalized results

**The Advanced Question Strategy:**

1. **Round 1:** "Ask me 10 questions to tailor this better"
2. **Round 2:** "Based on my answers, ask 10 more questions that fill in gaps"  
3. **Round 3:** "Give me 10 more detailed questions"
4. **Stop when:** AI starts repeating questions (means it has enough info)

**Pro Tips:**
- Use voice memos for answering questions (faster and more natural)
- For major decisions: Go through 20-30 questions
- For simple tasks: 3-5 questions are sufficient
- The more life-changing the decision, the more questions you should answer

## Complete Example: Putting It All Together

Here's how the full framework looks in practice:

```
**COMMAND:**
Recommend a comprehensive investment strategy 

**CONTEXT:**
for a 32-year-old software engineer with moderate risk tolerance, earning $90,000/year, with $25,000 in savings, looking to buy a home in 5 years while also building long-term wealth

**LOGIC:**
List the asset categories, explain the percent allocation for each, justify the rationale behind each choice, and include specific investment vehicles or funds

**ROLEPLAY:**
You are a certified financial advisor with 15 years of experience specializing in personal finance and mid-term investment planning for tech professionals

**FORMATTING:**
Format the response as:
1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Asset Allocation Table (with percentages and reasoning)
3. Specific Investment Recommendations
4. Timeline and Milestones
5. Risk Management Considerations

**QUESTIONS:**
Ask me 10 questions that will help you tailor this strategy even more specifically to my situation
```

## Best Practices and Pro Tips

### Model Selection
- **ChatGPT & Gemini:** Best for this framework (battle-tested)
- **Claude:** Works well with slight modifications
- **Specialized Models:** May require framework adjustments

### Context Balancing
- **High-Stakes Decisions:** Invest heavily in context and questions
- **Daily Tasks:** Use abbreviated version with 3-5 elements
- **Creative Projects:** Emphasize roleplay and formatting elements

### Voice Memo Strategy
- Use your phone's voice memo feature for answering AI questions
- Speak naturally and conversationally
- Let AI ask follow-up questions until it stops finding new angles

### Iteration Approach
1. Start with basic framework
2. Let AI ask questions and answer them
3. Refine the prompt based on gaps identified
4. Generate final output when AI stops asking fresh questions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping the Command:** Starting with questions instead of clear directives
2. **Insufficient Context:** Providing generic information that could apply to anyone
3. **No Output Structure:** Letting AI choose its own response format
4. **Generic Roles:** Using vague expertise instead of specific professional roles
5. **Stopping Too Early:** Not using the questions feature to refine results

## Advanced Applications

This framework scales from simple daily tasks to complex professional projects:

- **Personal:** Meal planning, workout routines, travel itineraries
- **Professional:** Business plans, marketing strategies, technical documentation  
- **Creative:** Content scripts, design briefs, storytelling frameworks
